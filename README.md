# denver-boulder-osm-cleanup
Audits and cleans OpenStreetMap xml file for Denver-Boulder. Converts file to json. 

This code is a working project as additional auditing and cleaning processes can be added over time. 
As is, the program cleans the Denver-Boulder xml file (https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts (Denver Boulder, Colorado OSM XML))
before coverting the xml into a json file. I used the file to import into Mongo DB for easy querying of the data.
